# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair-programming project done by Amanda Tilly & Madelene Trang, the objective was to build a Labyrinth Game app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

Using react and redux we approached this project slowly and step by step. We built a game in which the user is allowed to navigate a maze in the form of a text-based adventure provided by a backend API.
We used the API to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. Focusing on using Thunks and Redux we built the communication with the backend and styling was done with styled components.
